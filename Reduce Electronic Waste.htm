        <h2>We should know that</h2>
        <p> Republic Act 6969, the Toxic Substances and Hazardous Waste Control Act in the Philippines, is a law that keeps people and the environment safe from dangerous chemicals and waste. It tells companies how to handle, store, and get rid of these harmful materials without hurting anyone or the environment. The law sets rules for companies to follow, like sorting out these materials and using safer ways to manage them. It also makes sure that those who don't follow these rules face consequences, like fines or punishment, to keep everyone accountable for doing things the right way.</p>

            The Philippines faces challenges with e-waste disposal and recycling due to a lack of efficient recycling facilities, leading to improper disposal and environmental risks. This poses a significant problem, causing harm to both people and the environment. Despite this, the government has introduced regulations to encourage responsible e-waste practices among Filipinos. By handling electronic devices carefully and extracting usable contents for donation to charities, local organizations, or e-waste recycling facilities, people can contribute to keeping themselves and the planet safe and healthy.

        <h2>How to reduce it?</h2>
        <p>
          Managing e-waste through recycling is effective because it keeps harmful materials out of landfills, protecting the environment and our health. This method is
          sustainable because it reduces the need for new resources and energy. Many places have programs to recycle old electronics, making it doable for everyone. Information about e-waste recycling is easy to understand and encourages new ways to recycle. Yet, we still need to improve how we collect and recycle e-waste globally. To keep this solution working, we must educate, strengthen policies, and develop better recycling methods.

                <h2>Current Solutions Informal Recycling</h2>
                <p>  Companies from developed countries export their e-waste to developing countries because of high costs and strict regulations of formal recycling. In 2012, the United States produced 10 million tons of e-waste but only 29% of this is recycled. But according to the study,
                <strong>40% of supposedly recycled e-waste was actually exported to developing countries, </strong> usually in Asia where informal recycling is normally unlicensed and unregulated. Informal recycling workshops recover valuable materials manually by burning devices to melt non-valuable materials, use mercury and acids to recover gold, and dismantling devices by hand. Workers in this kind of facility usually donâ€™t wear proper protective equipment which exposes them to harmful chemicals and substances.
                <strong>This kind of recycling exposes workers to health hazards and results in environmental degradation.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Formal Recycling</h2>
                        <p>Proper or formal recycling involves disassembly, categorizing, cleaning and finally extracting valuable materials from e-waste.</p>

                    In the Philippines,<strong>Republic Act (RA) 6969</strong>  or the Toxic Substances and Hazardous and Nuclear Waste Control Act was enacted in 1990 as a regulatory framework on e-waste management. Treatment storage and disposal (TSD) is a pilot program under the Environmental Management Bureau(EMB) of DENR. The project aims to dispose of 1.12 tons from 50,000 units of electronic waste in 2019. TSD facilities are required to register with EMB to document and provide details of e-waste recycling operations.

                <br> <strong>This provides clear guidance and training on the proper dismantling and recycling of e-waste while providing green jobs to Filipinos.</strong>
